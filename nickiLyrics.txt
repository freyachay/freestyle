Yo, I had to reinvent, I put the V in-vent
I put the heat in vents, man, I've been competing since
I look beyond what people saying, and I see intent
Then I just sit back and decipher what they really meant
Cherish these nights, cherish these people
Life is a movie, but there'll never be a sequel
And I'm good with that as long as I'm peaceful
As long as seven years from now I'm taking my daughter to preschool
Cherish these days, man, do they go quick
Just yesterday, I swear it was 'o-six
Ten years ago, that's when you proposed
I looked down, Yes, I suppose

I lost my little cousin, to a senseless act of violence
His sister said he wanted to stay with me, but I didn't invite him
Why didn't he ask, or am I just buggin'?
Cause since I got fame, they don't act the same even though they know that I love 'em
Family ties, broken before me
Niggas trying to kill him, he ain't even call me
And that's the reflection of me, yes, I get it, I get it was all me
I pop a pill and remember the look in his eyes, the last day he saw me

Let me make this clear, I'm not difficult, I'm just 'bout my business
I'm not into fake industry parties, and fake agendas
Rock with people for how they make me feel, not what they give me
Even the ones that hurt me the most, I still show forgiveness
I love my mother more than life itself and that's a fact
I'd give it all if somehow I could just rekindle that
She never understands why I'm so overprotective
The more I work, the more I feel like somehow they're neglected
I want 'Caiah to go to college, just to say "We did it!"
My child with Aaron, would've have been sixteen any minute
So in some ways I feel like 'Caiah is the both of them
It's like he's 'Caiah's little angel, looking over him
And I know Jelani will always love me, and I'll always love him
And I'm just his little sister, not Nicki Minaj when I'm around him
Gee, we did it, let's leave this imprint
Just finished writing, this is The Pinkprint



I can’t fall for you, can’t give my all to you
I can’t let you think that I'ma let the game stall for you
Gotta protect me you gotta sweat me
You said you thought you was ready and I said "let’s see"
But I ain’t mean that, I need some fucking proof
Cause what happens if I fall in love, then you cut me loose?
You just a heart breaker, won’t let you break mine
Cause I’ll be smashing windows and cutting them brake lines

I thought eventually, you would let me go
That was my insecurities, and my ego
Missed my jump shot, missed my free throw
Miss the way we kiss, miss the D yo
Man it was good while it lasted
That shit wasn’t real, it was magic
If it was a record, it would have been classic
But fuck you though, orgasmic



Here we go again, it's the game we love
Sheets all over the floor and they laced with drugs
You ain't play your cards right, you had the Ace of Clubs
Hit you with the Ace of Spade, in your face, and shrugged
Blood drippin' out your arm on my Asian rugs
We was just planning a wedding, Caucasian doves
You was just tellin' your mans, that you hate the clubs
Now we in the crying game, heart laced with slugs

Welcome to the crying game, where you lose your soul
Where it ain't no E-Z Pass, you got to use the toll
Ain't no cruise control, you 'bout to lose control
Ain't no smilin' faces here, we slammin' doors and dishes
Sayin' we don't miss each other, but it's all fictitious
Sayin' that we had enough, but enough of what?
Another slap to the face, another uppercut
I'm just abusive by nature, not cause I hate ya
Not cause I wanna get someone to imitate ya
I know it's hard, I know I intimidate ya
But is you stayin' or goin'?
I couldn't breathe, and you ain't even know it
How come you never show it? All this love you speak of
All I want, is to love and be loved



I'll be back at eleven, you just act like a peasant
Got a bow on my panties, because my ass is a present
Yeah it's gooder than Meagan, you look good when you're beggin'
I be laughing when you beggin' me, to just put the head in
Let me sit on your face, it's ok you can play with it
When I'm bouncin' it, chill out and don't you make a mistake with it
Let me see what you're workin' with, If I'm ridin', I'm murkin' it
Slow grindin', I'm twerkin' it, yeah I bagged him, I Birkin'd it

Gimme brain, assume the position
Make me way smarter, like you was a magician
Paid my dues and tuition, it's good for your nutrition
Get head like a beautician, got me twitchin', finish your mission
You make it come down, you make it run down
I'ma need you to give these other dudes the rundown
You got that legendary, this shit is fake, scary
Got me seein' them fireworks, I'm on my Kate Perry



I'm with some hood girls lookin' back at it, and a good girl in my tax bracket
Got a black card that'll let Saks have it, these Chanel bags is a bad habit
I-I do balls, Dal Mavericks, my Maybach, black matted
Bitch, never left but I'm back at it,and I'm feelin' myself, jack rabbit
Feelin' myself, back off, cause I'm feelin' myself, jack off
He be thinking about me when he whacks off, wax on? Wax off
National anthem, hats off, then I curve that nigga, like a bad toss
Lemme get a number two, with some Mac sauce, "On The Run Tour", with my mask off

Kitty on fleek, pretty on fleek
Pretty gang always keep them niggas on geek
Ridin' through Texas, feed him for his breakfast
Everytime I whip it, I be talkin' so reckless
He said "Damn Nicki it's tight," I say "Yeah nigga you right"
He said "Damn, bae, you so little, but you be really takin' that pipe"
I said "Yes daddy I do, gimme brain like NYU"
I said "Teach me, nigga, teach me. All this learnin' here is by you"

Bitches ain't got punchlines or flow
I have both and an empire also
Keep gettin' gifts from Santa Claus at the North Pole
Today I'm icy, but I'm prayin' for some more snow
Let that ho ho, let that ho know -- he in love with that coco
Why these bitches don't never be learnin'?
You bitches will never get what I be earnin'
I'm still gettin' plaques, from my records that's urban
Ain't gotta rely on top 40,I am a Rap legend
Just go ask the Kings of Rap, who is the Queen and things of that
Nature? Look at my finger, that is a glacier, hits like a laser
Drippin' on that work, trippin' off that perc
Flippin' up my skirt and I be whippin' all that work
Takin' trips with all them ki's, car keys got B's
Stingin' with the Queen Bey and we be whippin' all of that D
Cause we dope girls we flawless, we the poster girls for all this
We run around with them ballers, only real niggas in my call list
I'm the big kahuna, go let them whores know
Just on this song alone, bitch is on her fourth flow



Yo! I never fucked Wayne, I never fucked Drake
On my life man, fuck's sake
If I did, I'd ménage with 'em and let 'em eat my ass like a cupcake
My man full, he just ate, I don't duck nobody but tape
Yeah, that was a setup for a punchline on duct tape
Worried 'bout if my butt fake, worry 'bout y'all niggas, us straight
These girls are my sons, John and Kate Plus Eight
When I walk in, sit up straight, I don't give a fuck if I was late
Dinner with my man on a G5 is my idea of a update
Hut-hut one, hut-hut two, big titties, big butt too
Fuck with them real niggas who don't tell niggas what they up to
Had to show bitches where the top is, ring finger where the rock is
These hoes couldn't test me, even if their name was Pop Quiz
Bad bitches who I fuck with, mad bitches we don't fuck with
I don't fuck with them chickens, unless they last name is Cutlet
Let it soak in like seasoning
And tell them bitches blow me: Lance Stephenson



I'm in this bitch, I'm getting money
One minute they hate me, then they love me
Ain't got nothing for me, these dudes is funny
That's why I'm throwing shade, like it's sunny
Who had Eminem on the first album?
Who had Kanye saying, "She a problem?"
Who the fuck came in the game, made her own column? Who made Lil Wayne, give 'em five million?
Why the fuck I gotta say it? Oh, you niggas don't know it yet?
Football touchdown, on the Boeing jet
You my son, but I'm just not showing yet
Wrist icy, but it ain't snowing yet
You can tell I'm the illest, cause my dividend is the biggest
Bitches ain't sitting with us, all my niggas in Margielas (Oh!)
Is pigs flying? Is these bitches trying me?
They think it's sweet? Oh, these bitches got diabetes
You seen that list? It was me, Baby, Jay-Z and Diddy!

I'm in this bitch, I'm high-saditty
I popped a Perc and I said thank you
I'm popping tags everyday, it look like my B'Day
These bitches suck, so I nickname these bitches BJ
They want that union, they want that D-Wade
I tell a ho, just be happy they getting leeway
My name Barbie, bitch, my name Barbie, bitch
Alexander made me Queen, I'm pulling up with the King, I'm late to my own party, bitch
Want it, I get it, I don't be wanting for nothing
I mean, I do what I do and it must be counting for something
I don't be jumping from topic to topic, stay in my pocket
I got your rent in my pocket, so can I pay you to pop it?
Cash money, getting six albums,no bitch niggas on a bitch album
You niggas apologize when a nigga diss you? That's a big problem



Hit me on the celly, watching Belly
God's son, I can see they study Makaveli
Peanut butter Benz, got them jelly at the deli
If you feeling like a ninja, I got a machete
Hell yeah, them girls bad, but I'm fucking heavy
I'mma fuck around and have them looking like spaghetti
I say some shit, he be like, "Yo, you so legendary"
But he can tell just by my face he ain't getting any

Meet me at the Rucker, take the Bruckner
It's just me and Young Yucka, taking suckers
For they money and they whips, putting kitten on lips
Dividing them dividends, get the money and dip
Keys to the nigga's safe, put it under my tits
He got ki's of that raw, it could fit in the six
Got a UPS connect, so we good on them trips
Automatic bottle service so we good in them VIPs, nigga

These civilians, what up nigga? Excuse my millions
I'm in the V like a widow's peak
It's just me and my Rolls Royce pillow seats
Why they staring at me? I brung MacLaren with me
Yo, matter of fact, I think I'mma bring Donna Karan with me
And you my son, I don't know, it's just the parent in me
I am the best, I am the queen, it's so apparent in me
I'm in Hollywood with Shia Labeouf (shy-and-the-buff)
Most of you rappers ain't eating, that diet is rough
You want some hot shit? Send that wire to us
I make them change their name to Diddy, retire the puff (Daddy)
I'm getting acting money
You niggas is Kevin Hart, y'all be acting funny
I'mma a keep a linebacker, tell 'em tackle for me
Yo, you seen my last pic, go double-tap that for me
Cock back, Red octagon, stop that



Yo, I just wanna be ya rider, you should pull up in that Spyder
You should let me hit the mic, and I ain't talking about the fighter
Get it lit without a lighter, let's pull an all-nighter
Tell me-tell me what you need, got the weed, I'm a bad little bitch and I never indict her
Get locked, I'mma write ya, you on the road? I'mma Skype ya
I don't wanna hype ya, but you a lucky nigga if my mean ass like ya
You ain't never have a bitch understand you, most of them wanna use you when they ran through
I just wanna be somebody that can add to, your wife, be a friend, be a teacher and a fan too
I just wanna listen, when you leave I say "damn, I fucking miss him"
I just wanna be your vixen, give you something real wet to put your lips in
I wanna be the only one that can check you, and still respect you
Cause it's you I would change for, you always make sure

Ayo, I just wanna be your first go to, do you like a real one supposed to, livin' bi-coastal
Scoop me in the truck, late night on a humble
Meet me out in Queens, where the city want a sundown
You could put your gun down, you could have fun now
You could tell you niggas that you won now, one down
Run through the clubs with the baddest, bitches is the maddest, nothin' else matters
And they say Birkin where the bag is, got a lot of bags, but we never got baggage
Winter Wonderland on my hands, call me Alice, balance
I'mma have you coming in my palace
London, Tokyo, Paris, let me update your status
Cause it's you I would change for, you always make sure



Rihmeek, I'mma have to tell the truth if I speak
Unless you want to play, you ain't say this the other day
You said you was in love, and I still didn't budge
Cause I already seen how you be going in when you be in them clubs
I could tell you was analyzing me, I could tell you was criticizing me
I could tell you was fantasizing that you would come slide in me and confide in me
He could tell that I was wifey material
He was liking my style in my videos
I wasn't looking for love I was looking for a buzz
So at times I would lie and say I'm busy, yo
Cause it's too much, and it's too clutch
Who wants rumors of the two of us
But when you're away, I can't get you out of my mind
But what if I'm not the one and you're wasting your time?
But you waited



Yo, he in love with a ghetto girl
He said he want a piece like Metta World
Pat, pat on the kitty cat
He don't mess with them regulars
He tryna kick it like a ninja
He tryna stick it like syringes
He don't ever play the benches
So I'ma let him touch it if he playin' with some inches

Put it in his face like a cop badge
He wanna pound it like a hashtag
He gonna have to get the wash rag
If he shoot it up, I'm gonna bust back
Them island girls is the baddest
American girls run the planet
South African, European, Asian, Australian
And my Canadian Girls



Boy toy named Troy used to live in Detroit
Big dope dealer money, he was gettin' some coins
Was in shootouts with the law, but he live in a palace
Bo-bought me Alexander McQueen, he was keeping me stylish
Now that's real, real, real
Gun in my purse, bitch, I came dressed to kill
Who wanna go first? I had them pushing daffodils
I'm high as hell, I only took a half a pill
I'm on some dumb shit, by the way, what he say?
He can tell I ain't missing no meals
Come through and fuck him in my automobile
Let him eat it with his grills and he tellin' me to chill
And he telling me it's real, that he love my sex appeal
Say he don't like 'em boney, he want something he can grab
So I pulled up in the Jag, and I hit him with the jab like
Dun-d-d-dun-dun-d-d-dun-dun
